This is my final project for CS50x. 

I made a web application that uses a SQL database a flask server and HTML web pages.
This application first allows users to create accounts and make polls. These polls can have as many catagories as the user desires.
Then once the poll is created other users can participate in these polls by joining them via a unique code that each poll has.
These polls then can be deactivated by the admin of the poll, which will allow the admin to see the results and end the poll.
