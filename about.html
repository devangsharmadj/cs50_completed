            <h4> Introduction: </h4>
            <p class="about">
                Hello, this is Devang Sharma, 9th grader of Eden Prairie HS. I am currently living in Minnesota with my family my parents and my sister, who is nearly 3 years younger than me. I enjoy being outdoors and playing with my friends. In addition, I am very energetic and love to spend time
                with my family via playing cards.
            </p>
            <h4> Hobbies: </h4>
            <p class="about">
                I have a lot of hobbies, but my biggest one is definitely coding. In addition to coding, I also enjoy running. I run for my school's Track
                team and Cross Country team. I am also a part of the varsity math team for my school. Beyond that, I also enjoy video gaming and play a variety of games on
                Xbox and mobile, but I do not just play games, I also love reading. I read a variety of genres in books. Some of them include fiction, which I enjoy the most, adventure, non-fiction etc. These are my hobbies that I love doing whenever I am bored or just need a break from my
                regular routine.
            </p>
            <h4> My School: </h4>
            <p class="about">
                I just passed 8th grade from Eagle Ridge Academy. Eagle Ridge Academy is a charter school that is often confused for a private school
                because students there have to wear uniforms. Eagle Ridge is a fairly small school, since it is the size of a typical middle school but it has grades
                kindergarten to 12th all in one building. Despite Eagle Ridge being an awesome school, I will be attending high school at Eden Prairie HS which
                is a public school. I will be taking many courses as a freshman at Eden Prairie, for example: Algebra 2, PreCalc, Robotics, Spreadsheet and much more.
                I am very excited for High School!üòÅ
