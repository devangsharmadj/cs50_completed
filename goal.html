            <h4>Why Computer Science? </h4>
            <p class="about user-select-auto" >
                I want to pursue a career in computer science because computer science is a very exciting topic for me. It is very exciting because I just
                love the way that we can use logic and light-bulbs to get things done from computers in a very fast way. I am interested in AI
                in the computer science field. I am interested in AI, because with AI we could solve a lot of problems a lot faster than humans can, and with AI
                we could also train computers to act like humans, which seems very cool to me. Lastly, I would like to have a career in computer science because
                I would never stop learning in computer science, since computer science is a vast field with a lot of topics.
